        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook explored the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using NumPy and compared its performance to a similar model implemented using PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "### CNN Architecture Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "The CNN architecture implemented in this notebook, in both the NumPy and PyTorch versions, utilizes several fundamental building blocks:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Convolutional Layers (Conv2D):** These layers apply a set of learnable filters (kernels) to the input image. Each filter slides over the input, performing element-wise multiplications and summing the results to create a feature map. This process helps in detecting spatial hierarchies of features, such as edges, corners, and textures. The NumPy implementation (`Conv2D`) manually handles padding and strides, while the PyTorch implementation (`nn.Conv2d`) provides these functionalities directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Activation Functions (ReLU):** Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a non-linear activation function that introduces non-linearity into the network. It outputs the input directly if it's positive, and zero otherwise (`max(0, input)`). This non-linearity allows the network to learn more complex patterns than a linear model. Both implementations (`ReLu` in NumPy and `F.relu` in PyTorch) apply this function element-wise.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Pooling Layers (MaxPool2D):** Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps while retaining the most important information. Max pooling, as used here, selects the maximum value within a defined window (kernel size) as it slides over the feature map. This helps to reduce the number of parameters and computation, and also provides some spatial invariance. The NumPy implementation (`MaxPool2D`) manually tracks the indices of the maximum values for backpropagation, while PyTorch's `nn.MaxPool2d` handles this automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Flatten Layer:** This layer reshapes the multi-dimensional output of the convolutional and pooling layers into a one-dimensional vector. This is necessary before feeding the output into a fully connected layer. Both the NumPy (`Flatten`) and PyTorch (`x.view(-1, ...)`) implementations perform this reshaping.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Fully Connected Layers (Dense/Linear):** These layers are standard neural network layers where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. They take the flattened feature vector as input and perform a linear transformation (matrix multiplication with weights and adding biases) followed by an activation function. The NumPy implementation (`Fully_Connected_Layer`) includes the weight and bias updates within the layer's backward method, while in PyTorch (`nn.Linear`), the optimization is handled separately by an optimizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Softmax:** The softmax function is typically applied to the output of the final fully connected layer in a classification task. It converts the raw output scores (logits) into probabilities that sum up to 1. Each value in the output represents the probability of the input belonging to a particular class. In the NumPy implementation, this is part of the `SoftmaxWithCrossEntropy` class's forward pass.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Loss Function (Cross-Entropy Loss):** Cross-entropy loss is a common loss function for multi-class classification problems. It measures the difference between the predicted probabilities (from the softmax layer) and the true class labels. The goal of training is to minimize this loss. The NumPy implementation calculates this within the `SoftmaxWithCrossEntropy` class, and PyTorch uses `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Comparison of NumPy and PyTorch Models\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook clearly demonstrates the differences in performance and training efficiency between the NumPy-based scratch implementation and the PyTorch implementation:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Training Data Size:** The NumPy model was trained on a small subset of the training data (1000 samples) due to the significantly slower execution speed of the manual implementation. The PyTorch model was trained on the full training dataset (60000 samples).\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Training Loss:** The training loss for the NumPy model decreased slowly over 10 epochs, ending at a loss of approximately 2.05. The training loss for the PyTorch model decreased much more rapidly and significantly over just 5 epochs, reaching a much lower average loss of approximately 0.016. This highlights the computational efficiency and optimization capabilities of PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Training Time:** Each epoch of the NumPy model training took around 150 seconds, even with a small subset of data. The PyTorch model trained on the full dataset completed 5 epochs in a relatively short amount of time (around 10 minutes based on the timestamps), showcasing the power of optimized libraries and potentially GPU acceleration (although it was run on CPU in this case).\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Test Performance:** The NumPy model evaluated on 1000 test samples achieved a low accuracy of 26.80% and a test loss of 2.1149. The PyTorch model evaluated on the full test dataset achieved a high accuracy of 98.92%. This significant difference in performance is primarily due to training on the full dataset and the optimized nature of the PyTorch framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Loss Functions:** Both implementations use the concept of cross-entropy loss. The NumPy version implements it manually within the `SoftmaxWithCrossEntropy` class, including the softmax calculation for numerical stability. The PyTorch version uses the built-in and highly optimized `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while the NumPy implementation provided valuable insight into the inner workings of each layer and the backpropagation process, it is significantly less efficient for practical deep learning tasks compared to a framework like PyTorch, which leverages optimized operations and simplifies the development process. The PyTorch model achieved a much higher accuracy on the MNIST dataset due to training on the full dataset and the inherent advantages of the framework."
